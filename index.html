		<h2>Project Purpose</h2>
		<p>This purpose of this project is to control a laser pointer using two 
		stepper motors connected to a ChipKit by Digilent, which is an offshoot of an Arduino.</p>  

		<p>This project will be due in class on December 6th, 2016, however one of the goals of this 
		project is to beat the schedule and have it turned in by December 1st, 2016.</p>
