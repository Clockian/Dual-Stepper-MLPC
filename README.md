# Dual-Stepper-MLPC
Class project
This project for CSC&EEE 230 is to control a laser pointer using two stepper motors connected to a ChipKit by Digilent, 
which is an offshoot of an Arduino.

This project will be due on December 6th, 2016, however one of the goals of this project is to beat the schedule and 
have it turned in by December 1st, 2016.

The full and proper title for this project is Dual-Stepper-Motor-Laser-Pointer-Control.
